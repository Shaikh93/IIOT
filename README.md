# IIOT
## Introduction
The industrial internet of things (IIoT) refers to the extension and use of the internet of things (IoT) in industrial sectors and applications. With a strong focus on machine-to-machine (M2M) communication, big data, and machine learning, the IIoT enables industries and enterprises to have better efficiency and reliability in their operations. The IIoT encompasses industrial applications, including robotics, medical devices, and software-defined production processes.
## **Setting up the development environment for IIOT**
### Installing Dependencies
you will need to install Node.js, react and MQTT
### 1. Node.js
#### step-1: Download the installer
Download the windows intaller from [NodeJs official website](https://nodejs.org/en/). Make sure you have downloaded the latest version of NodeJs. It includes the NPM package manager.<br>

The LTS (Long-term Support) version is highly recommended for you. After the download of the installer package, install it with a double-click on it.<br>
Now .msi file will be downloaded to your browser. Choose the desired location for that.<br>
