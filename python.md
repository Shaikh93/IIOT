# Python
## introduction
Python is a **dynamic, interpreted (bytecode-compiled) language** . There are no type declarations of variables, parameters, functions, or methods in source code. This makes the code short and flexible, and you lose the compile-time type checking of the source code. It is largely used by professional programmers and developers across a variety of fields, including Web Development and Machine Learning.<br>

Open the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/) in your web browser. Navigate to the Downloads tab for Windows.
